##SERVICE INFORMATION   
This service is based on a hexagonal architecture and DDD. This ensures the re-usability of the business logic by making it technical-agnostic.    
The Domain layer is the core of the architecture and should not be affected by a stack change, it dependes on nothing but himself.  
This service lives on a multi-module spring boot project.   
These modules are:  
- Application: Exposes a rest endpoint.
- Domain:  The core, contains the business logic. Has no dependency on other layers.
- Infrastructure:  Communicates with the database.
- Price-Launcher: Bootstrap all the modules.
  
##UNIT TESTS   
Each module has a battery of unit tests.  
In Application module there are unit tests for Test1 to Test5 requested cases.
